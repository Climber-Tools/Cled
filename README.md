</p>

This repository contains the source code to the Cled editor, along with various scripts used to import assets used from [Clis](https://github.com/Climber-Apps/Cled/), released under the GPLv3 license.

## Running Cled
First, download the lastest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Climber-Apps/Cled/releases).

To use Cled, you need a wall and holds dataset.
A dataset example, along with the specification, can be found in `Models/Example`.
This dataset can then be imported to Cled either by `File > New`, or by pressing `Ctrl+N`.

For additional information, see the [thesis](https://github.com/Climber-Apps/Thesis).
